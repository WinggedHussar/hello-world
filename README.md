# hello-world
This repository contains my coding in its infancy.
Howdy, my name is Matthew. I have one year left before I acquire my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Information Systems. My current GPA is 3.6. To be frank, I am disappointed in the lack of actual coding knowledge I have acquired thus far. However, I am hopeful that I can gain the skills I desire through this platform.
